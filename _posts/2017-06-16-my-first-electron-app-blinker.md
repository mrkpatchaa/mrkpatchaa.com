A week ago, I discovered a very useful website and I thought I should make it an application.
This is the website : <a href="http://www.blynker.com/" target="blank" rel="noopener">http://www.blynker.com/</a>.<br/>
The principle is simple : it reminds you to take your eyes away from your computer every 20 minutes. So here is **Blinker**.

I do a lot of stuff on my computer and I don't always take a break to rest. We can see it like a <a href="https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique" target="blank" rel="noopener">pomodoro</a>, but not just when you want to concentrate on something.

### **Planning the application**

**The idea is simple** : Every x (20) minutes you notify the user that he should take a break. 20 seconds later, he can go back to work.

**The technology** : I do a lot of Javascript so I decided to go with a tool that could help me create my _native_ application in Javascript. With no doubt I decided to go with <a href="https://electron.atom.io/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Electron</a>. Many applications, including Slack, Atom, VS Code, are built on top of Electron. And it has the advantage to help you build cross platform applications.

### **Creating the application**

Electron provides a quick start to help you understand the concept.

```bash
# Clone the Quick Start repository
$ git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start

# Go into the repository
$ cd electron-quick-start

# Install the dependencies and run
$ npm install && npm start
```

Blinker is a "window less" application (as it just shows a tray icon) so I deleted the `index.html` and `renderer.js` files.

Electron provides a <a href="https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/tray/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Tray</a> item that helps you add icons and context menus to the systemâ€™s notification area.

```javascript
const electron = require('electron')
const { app, Tray, Menu, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
```

Here is the list of dependencies :

<a href="https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier" target="blank" rel="noopener">**node-notifier**</a> : to display system notifications. I first used the HTML5 native Notification API, but it didn't work as our application doesn't run in a window.

```javascript
notifier.notify({
  title: 'Startup status changed',
  message: launchOnStartup
    ? 'You will have to launch the application every time you log in'
    : 'Great! Application will launch on system startup',
  icon: path.join(__dirname, 'icons/eye.png'),
  contentImage: '',
  sound: playSound, // true of false
})
```

<a href="https://github.com/Teamwork/node-auto-launch/" target="blank" rel="noopener">**auto-launch**</a> : to launch application on startup ;)

```javascript
const appAutoLauncher = new AutoLaunch({
  name: 'Blinker',
  isHidden: true,
  mac: {
    useLaunchAgent: true,
  },
})
```

<a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-store" target="blank" rel="noopener">**electron-store**</a> : to save application specific configuration (like sound, autostart)

```javascript
const store = new Store({
  defaults: {
    config: {
      launchOnStartup: true,
      playSound: true,
    },
  },
})
const config = store.get('config')
```

I have released the <a href="https://github.com/mrkpatchaa/blinker/releases/tag/v01" target="" rel="noopener">first version</a> for Linux and MacOS. If you are on windows, you can just checkout the code and build for windows.

Feel free to checkout the code on <a href="https://github.com/mrkpatchaa/blinker/" target="blank" rel="noopener">github</a>, submit pull requests or open issues if something is not working as expected.

Cheers.
