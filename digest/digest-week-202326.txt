<h3><a href="https://hbr.org/2023/06/to-build-a-top-performing-team-ask-for-85-effort">To Build a Top Performing Team, Ask for 85% Effort</a></h3>
<p>An outdated way of thinking about peak performance is: “maximum effort = maximum results.” But research shows that it doesn’t actually work that way in reality. Here’s what actually works: The 85% rule, which counterintuitively suggests that to reach maximum output, you need to refrain from giving maximum effort. Operating at 100% effort all of the time will result in burnout and ultimately less-optimal results. While the precise number 85% may just be a rule of thumb, it’s a helpful one for managers who want to create high-performance teams without burning people out.
