3:T582,<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm Médédé Raymond, an experienced Software Engineer with over 10 years of industry expertise. I'm a geek at heart, a lifelong learner, and an adept problem solver skilled at tackling challenges.</p>
<p>I have a deep passion for all things related to Web, Mobile, and Commerce. My preferred coding language is Javascript, and I've been actively involved in React/React Native projects and ecosystem for quite some time.</p>
<p>Throughout my relatively long career, I've worked with a diverse range of technologies and programming languages, including PHP, Java, SQL, DevOps, Commerce (B2C/B2B/OMS), Mainframe, Cloud, Serverless, Salesforce, CMS, SEO, and more.</p>
<p>In my free time, I work on personal projects (although I'm still aspiring to become a successful entrepreneur 🫣), contribute to open-source initiatives, and constantly explore articles on Software Architecture &#x26; Design, IT Security, Leadership, Management, and related topics.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've excelled in various roles, such as Developer, Technical Architect, Tech Lead, Manager, and have often performed a versatile combination of these responsibilities.</p>
<p>I would be delighted to have a conversation with you about any of these topics. Feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrkpatchaa/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/mrkpatchaa">Twitter</a>.</p>
