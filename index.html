Here’s what actually works: The 85% rule, which counterintuitively suggests that to reach maximum output, you need to refrain from giving maximum effort. Operating at 100% effort all of the time will result in burnout and ultimately less-optimal results.

Facebook officially provides [**documentation**](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html) on debugging a RN application in Google Chrome taking advantages of Chrome Developer Tools.\r\n\r\nTo debug the JavaScript code in Chrome, you need to select \"Debug JS Remotely\" from the Developer Menu \\(⌘D or ⌘M depending if you are running iOS or Android simulator\\). This will open a new tab at [**http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui**](http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui) when your application launches.\r\n\r\nThis is good, but not enough. It is difficult to set up React Developer Tools Chrome extension for React Native. You need a custom extension to debug Redux...\r\n\r\nYou also have the choice to use standalone version of React Developer Tools to debug the component hierarchy. You can install it using **npm**.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install -g react-devtools\r\n```\r\n\r\nLaunch it from the terminal\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ react-devtools\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is an all in one solution, called -you guessed it- [**React Native Debugger**](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger). It is a standalone application based on the official debugger of React Native which includes React inspector and Redux DevTools, offering a debugger for applications using Redux or not.\r\n\r\n### How to install React Native Debugger\r\n\r\nThe application is based on **Electron** :\\). Prebuilt binaries are available for Windows, Linux and macOS on the [**releases**](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/releases) page of the project. For macOS, you can install it via **Homebrew Cask**.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew update \u0026\u0026 brew cask install react-native-debugger\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n#### 1. Manually\r\n\r\nUsing React Native Debugger doesn't require custom configuration, as it listens by default on the React Native packager port \\(8081\\) by default. Follow these steps to start debugging :\r\n\r\n1. Make sure all [http://localhost:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;/debugger-ui](http://localhost:\u003cport\u003e/debugger-ui) pages are closed\r\n2. Launch React Native Debugger\r\n3. Launch your application and enable [**Debug JS Remotely**](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html#accessing-the-in-app-developer-menu)\r\n   \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\n#### 2. Automatically with react-native-debugger-open\r\n\r\nThere is a [**package**](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/tree/master/npm-package) which configures your application to automatically open React Native Debugger instead of Google Chrome when it launches. It replaces `open debugger-ui with Chrome` by `open React Native Debugger` from react-native packager\r\n\r\nTo install and configure the package, follow these steps :\r\n\r\n- Install the package :\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm i --save-dev react-native-debugger-open # or -g\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Add this to your package.json\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n    ... your current scripts configuration\r\n    // add this line\r\n    \"postinstall\": \"rndebugger-open\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will be run after `npm install`. \\(You can run `npm run postinstall first`\\) The `./node_modules/react-native/local-cli/server/middleware/getDevToolsMiddleware.js` code will be replaced.\r\n\r\nAnd voilà. Now, every time your application launches, it will open React Native Debugger. If the React Native Debugger app is already opened, it will attach automatically the debugging session. But It is recommended to first close the React Native Debugger windows, just to make sure you won't have unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Going further\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to read about debugging React Native applications. I gave an introduction which covers simple cases. If you need advanced configuration in the debugging process, you could read more about with the following resources.\r\n\r\n- **React Native Debugger Documentation** : [https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger\\#documentation](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger#documentation)\r\n- **React Native Debugger Open** : [https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/tree/master/npm-package\\#usage](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/tree/master/npm-package#usage)\r\n- **Official React Native Debugging documentation** : [https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html)\r\n- **Google** : [http://bfy.tw/DR8k](http://bfy.tw/DR8k) :\\)\r\n","createdAt":"2023-06-15T11:32:31Z","labels":{"nodes":[{"name":"blog:published"}]},"milestone":{"title":"blog"},"excerpt":"Debugging on React Native is not as ease as we think.

So here is **Blinker**.\r\n\r\nI do a lot of stuff on my computer and I don't always take a break to rest. We can see it like a \u003ca href=\"https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003epomodoro\u003c/a\u003e, but not just when you want to concentrate on something.\r\n\r\n### **Planning the application**\r\n\r\n**The idea is simple** : Every x (20) minutes you notify the user that he should take a break. 20 seconds later, he can go back to work.\r\n\r\n**The technology** : I do a lot of Javascript so I decided to go with a tool that could help me create my _native_ application in Javascript. With no doubt I decided to go with \u003ca href=\"https://electron.atom.io/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eElectron\u003c/a\u003e. Many applications, including Slack, Atom, VS Code, are built on top of Electron. And it has the advantage to help you build cross platform applications.\r\n\r\n### **Creating the application**\r\n\r\nElectron provides a quick start to help you understand the concept.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Clone the Quick Start repository\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start\r\n\r\n# Go into the repository\r\n$ cd electron-quick-start\r\n\r\n# Install the dependencies and run\r\n$ npm install \u0026\u0026 npm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nBlinker is a \"window less\" application (as it just shows a tray icon) so I deleted the `index.html` and `renderer.js` files.\r\n\r\nElectron provides a \u003ca href=\"https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/tray/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eTray\u003c/a\u003e item that helps you add icons and context menus to the system’s notification area.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst electron = require('electron')\r\nconst { app, Tray, Menu, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the list of dependencies :\r\n\r\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e**node-notifier**\u003c/a\u003e : to display system notifications. I first used the HTML5 native Notification API, but it didn't work as our application doesn't run in a window.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nnotifier.notify({\r\n  title: 'Startup status changed',\r\n  message: launchOnStartup\r\n    ? 'You will have to launch the application every time you log in'\r\n    : 'Great! Application will launch on system startup',\r\n  icon: path.join(__dirname, 'icons/eye.png'),\r\n  contentImage: '',\r\n  sound: playSound, // true of false\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Teamwork/node-auto-launch/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e**auto-launch**\u003c/a\u003e : to launch application on startup ;)\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst appAutoLauncher = new AutoLaunch({\r\n  name: 'Blinker',\r\n  isHidden: true,\r\n  mac: {\r\n    useLaunchAgent: true,\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-store\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e**electron-store**\u003c/a\u003e : to save application specific configuration (like sound, autostart)\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst store = new Store({\r\n  defaults: {\r\n    config: {\r\n      launchOnStartup: true,\r\n      playSound: true,\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n})\r\nconst config = store.get('config')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have released the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/mrkpatchaa/blinker/releases/tag/v01\" target=\"\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003efirst version\u003c/a\u003e for Linux and MacOS.
