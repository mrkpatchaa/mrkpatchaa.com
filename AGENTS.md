# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Working rules
- State your assumptions; when the request is ambiguous, ask rather than guess.
- Simplicity first: no speculative abstractions. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite.
- Surgical changes: don't touch adjacent code; only remove orphans you created.
- Goal-driven: every task gets a verifiable "done means" (tests, build, observable behaviour) before work starts. Never report done on a self-report — run the gates. A gate counts only once you have seen it finish; one that is still running, was skipped or could not run is named as such, never called verified.
- Tests: add one only when you can name the behaviour it protects, the credible regression that would fail it, and why the existing tests (e2e included) miss it; otherwise extend an existing case or leave it out. No tests that restate the implementation, copy fixtures, or keep a test-only export alive. A bug fix's regression test must fail on the old code. Pruning old ones: `/ai:test-audit`.
- Long runs: when a step doesn't need my input, keep going and put status notes in the same message as the next action; stop only when you can't continue without me or before anything destructive (the /ai:loop gates still wait for my yes). Build what was asked; list extras as suggestions instead of building them.
- Before editing, read the whole file (or the whole function you're changing); a truncated read is not the whole file, so read the rest first. If you've edited the same spot three times for one request, stop and re-read the request: repeated patches usually mean it was misread.
- When I correct you, re-read my message and say in one line what changes, then do it. Ask first only if the correction is ambiguous.
- When the same approach fails twice (a command, a fix that doesn't hold), change approach instead of retrying it. If a second approach also fails, stop and tell me what you tried, what failed and what you'd try next.
- Before you report back, re-read my original message and check off every part of it; finish what's missing or say which parts are left and why. In a long session, also re-read it before starting each new part.
- When a turn ends because you need something from me, end it with a short "What I need from you" list: numbered, one concrete action per item (what to do, where, what to send back), the quickest or most blocking first, and what you'll get on with meanwhile. Nothing needed: say so in one line. Never bury a request for me in the middle of a long update.
- Write what I read about 80% of the way to ASD-STE100: replies, reports, handoffs, specs, PR descriptions and review findings. Put one topic in each sentence. Keep sentences that give a step under 20 words and other sentences under 25. Keep paragraphs to six sentences. Use the active voice, and the imperative for steps. Give one thing one name all the way through. Name the number, file or command instead of a vague word. Write two sentences instead of a semicolon. Use a list for three or more items or steps. The rule does not cover code, commands, paths, identifiers, quoted errors, product or marketing copy, or text in other languages.

## Lanes
- Real features: `/ai:loop` (spec → independent spec review → the `implementer` agent builds → the `verifier` agent checks risky changes → independent QA). Specs live in `docs/specs/` as `SPEC-<slug>.md`; never overwrite an existing spec.
- Docs layout: specs go in `docs/specs/` as `SPEC-<slug>.md`; plans, task lists, handoffs and run notes go in `docs/tasks/`; shipped or dropped work goes in `docs/archive/`. Create the folders when missing; nothing goes at the repo root. When work ships or is dropped, `git mv` its spec and tasks to `docs/archive/` under the same names, add a line to `docs/archive/README.md` (file, what shipped or why it was dropped, month) and fix any path that cites them (`git grep <file name>`). Never edit an archived spec to match today's code; new work gets a new spec. `/ai:ship` archives what its branch finished; when `docs/specs/` or `docs/tasks/` holds something that looks finished or untouched for a month, list it and move it on my yes.
- Cloudflare: use the `cf` CLI. A folder with `cloudflare.config.ts` builds and deploys with cf (`cf build`, `cf deploy --mode <env>`), even while its old Wrangler config is still there; a folder with only a Wrangler config (`wrangler.toml`/`wrangler.jsonc`) keeps `wrangler` and its package scripts until it is migrated with `cf migrate`. Find commands with `cf cli search "<task>"` and `cf schema <command>`; run every write with `--dry-run` first; cf takes resource IDs, not names. Not in cf yet: live logs (`npx wrangler tail <worker>`) and single secrets (`npx wrangler secret put <NAME> --name <worker>`).
- Wrapping up a branch: `/ai:ship`. A pre-commit hook runs one independent review on every `git commit`; prefix `AI_LOOP_SKIP_REVIEW=1` only when a review just ran. Where `git config ai-loop.jevtriage` is set, a Jev triage of the diff runs first (`shadow` only logs; `on` may skip trivial commits and sharpen risky reviews).
- Mechanical work (renames, boilerplate, test scaffolds, surveys) goes through the `grunt` agent, always with a self-contained brief: it uses the cheap OpenCode lane while that lane is on (`ai-lane` shows; `ai-lane off` turns it off for this clone, `AI_CHEAP_LANE=off` for a shell) and does the work itself on Sonnet otherwise. When `grunt-run --free-status` exits 0 a free model is on and the lane costs nothing: also send it first drafts of well-specified code, tests and docs, then review and run the gates yourself.
- Delegating to any subagent: give it a scope and acceptance criteria; it returns changed files, the test commands with their exit status, and log paths rather than pasted logs. One writer per file.
- Reviews come from Codex first, an OpenCode Go model second, the Claude `reviewer` agent last (flagged as same-vendor).
- Gotchas: a folder where mistakes recur carries a nested `AGENTS.md` of facts (what broke, the check that catches it) beside a one-line `CLAUDE.md` containing `@AGENTS.md`. Read it before working there; when a review finds a repeatable mistake, propose one line for it rather than fixing the instance only.
