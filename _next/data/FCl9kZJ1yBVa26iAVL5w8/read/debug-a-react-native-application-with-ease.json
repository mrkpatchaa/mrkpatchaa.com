{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Debug a React Native application with ease","body":"\r\nDebugging on React Native is not as ease as we think. Facebook officially provides [**documentation**](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html) on debugging a RN application in Google Chrome taking advantages of Chrome Developer Tools.\r\n\r\nTo debug the JavaScript code in Chrome, you need to select \"Debug JS Remotely\" from the Developer Menu \\(⌘D or ⌘M depending if you are running iOS or Android simulator\\). This will open a new tab at [**http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui**](http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui) when your application launches.\r\n\r\nThis is good, but not enough. It is difficult to set up React Developer Tools Chrome extension for React Native. You need a custom extension to debug Redux...\r\n\r\nYou also have the choice to use standalone version of React Developer Tools to debug the component hierarchy. You can install it using **npm**.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install -g react-devtools\r\n```\r\n\r\nLaunch it from the terminal\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ react-devtools\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is an all in one solution, called -you guessed it- [**React Native Debugger**](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger). It is a standalone application based on the official debugger of React Native which includes React inspector and Redux DevTools, offering a debugger for applications using Redux or not.\r\n\r\n### How to install React Native Debugger\r\n\r\nThe application is based on **Electron** :\\). Prebuilt binaries are available for Windows, Linux and macOS on the [**releases**](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/releases) page of the project. For macOS, you can install it via **Homebrew Cask**.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew update && brew cask install react-native-debugger\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n#### 1. Manually\r\n\r\nUsing React Native Debugger doesn't require custom configuration, as it listens by default on the React Native packager port \\(8081\\) by default. Follow these steps to start debugging :\r\n\r\n1. Make sure all [http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/debugger-ui](http://localhost:<port>/debugger-ui) pages are closed\r\n2. Launch React Native Debugger\r\n3. Launch your application and enable [**Debug JS Remotely**](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html#accessing-the-in-app-developer-menu)\r\n   <br /><br />\r\n\r\n#### 2. Automatically with react-native-debugger-open\r\n\r\nThere is a [**package**](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/tree/master/npm-package) which configures your application to automatically open React Native Debugger instead of Google Chrome when it launches. It replaces `open debugger-ui with Chrome` by `open React Native Debugger` from react-native packager\r\n\r\nTo install and configure the package, follow these steps :\r\n\r\n- Install the package :\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm i --save-dev react-native-debugger-open # or -g\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Add this to your package.json\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n    ... your current scripts configuration\r\n    // add this line\r\n    \"postinstall\": \"rndebugger-open\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will be run after `npm install`. \\(You can run `npm run postinstall first`\\) The `./node_modules/react-native/local-cli/server/middleware/getDevToolsMiddleware.js` code will be replaced.\r\n\r\nAnd voilà. Now, every time your application launches, it will open React Native Debugger. If the React Native Debugger app is already opened, it will attach automatically the debugging session. But It is recommended to first close the React Native Debugger windows, just to make sure you won't have unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Going further\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to read about debugging React Native applications. I gave an introduction which covers simple cases. If you need advanced configuration in the debugging process, you could read more about with the following resources.\r\n\r\n- **React Native Debugger Documentation** : [https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger\\#documentation](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger#documentation)\r\n- **React Native Debugger Open** : [https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/tree/master/npm-package\\#usage](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/tree/master/npm-package#usage)\r\n- **Official React Native Debugging documentation** : [https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html)\r\n- **Google** : [http://bfy.tw/DR8k](http://bfy.tw/DR8k) :\\)\r\n","createdAt":"2023-06-15T11:32:31Z","labels":{"nodes":[{"name":"blog:published"}]},"milestone":{"title":"blog"},"excerpt":"Debugging on React Native is not as ease as we think.
